# ReadSocial

## Purpose

This application is a CMS-style website where users can review books and enjoy an unfiltered, non-critic, review of other users using the website. 
Users that create an account are encouraged to rate and comment on books that they have read. Authenticated users can edit and delete their own posts, and they also gain access to other reviews of the same movie as well as other movie reviews by users of the website.

The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm in its architectural structure.


## Technologies Used:
